## Copy-Hex-to-Clipboard
Copy to clipboard the HEX color of the pixel under your cursor using `Ctrl + Win + Left Click`

## Open-new-explorer-window-same-folder
Open new explorer window with the same path as the currently focused folder: I often use `Win + E` default shortcut to open the Explorer, but oftentimes I need to open a new window within the same location to move/organize some files. So why not use `Ctrl + Win + E` shortcut to do that?
